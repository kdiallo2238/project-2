<p class="text1"> What? Speak English! One student before said to me one time during lunch break. I was sitting in the cafteria with couple of other students. During, that time I was on the phone with my mom immediately when I started talking in my native language; Fulani. One student in the group interrupted my call by talking over me and she started making weird noises with her teeth that few of the students that where sitting next to her started laughing. And when I got off of the phone she start by saying; "eeyee you" (with a broken-english accent). I looked at her and she said "you african booty scratcher". I got so mad to the point where me and her started to argue with each other. I chose to talk to about this specific topic because this ties down to one of the chapters in the book, "Citizen: An American Lyric" written by Claudia Rankine. In page.45 the author makes the reader picture themselves in a sitution where they are on the phone having a coversation with a company manager and agreeing to come into to the office to sign couple forms. And you as the reader you come into the office the following day; you enter the manager sees you and automatically looks at you with a surprise look and he tells you he had no clue that you are a black person. This peice of quote relates to my story when one student decided it was okay to make a joke about my native language and said a bad word to me.

<p class="text2">Is it true Do I Look Like what they think of me ? That same day I went home and googled those words. Google tells me is a racist term used by American school aged children which compares sterotypical primate behavior to people from the African continent.

<p class="text3"> If I was to ask the same person who made these remarks what it means. They will definitely tell me it just a simple joke with no literal definition. And it's just meant to be funny to them. But to me is wasn't. </p>
